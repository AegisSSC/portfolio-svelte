# Slick Portfolio With Svelte.

Vercel-like style portfolio template for developers.

If you want to use the template as it is, you can :

- update `src/lib/params.ts` with your data.
- update `src/lib/index.scss` for custom styling.
- update `static/favicon.ico` to customize the tab's icon.

Feel free to explore and hack the template to your needs if you feel like it.

Before deploying to `GitHub Pages`:

- make sure to change the `base` parameter in `svelte.config.js`.
- allow `GitHub Pages` in your repo settings.

## Known issues:

- Svelte no longer support `node 14`, use a newer version instead.
